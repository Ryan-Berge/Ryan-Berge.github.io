            <h2>What is skiing</h2>
            <p> Skiing is a recreational activity and competitive sport where the participants use "skis" 
                to glide down or across snowy terrain. This can include but not limited to: small slopes, 
                cross country flats, and extreme terrain. Skiing is widely enjoyed due to the thrill of gliding 
                across the snow. Some conclude that skiing gives a small sense of flying, adding to its incredible thrill.
                The ability to control speed and direction is also a major aspect of skiing.
                Some glide at impressive speeds, while others prefer a slower pace. Skiing is an incredible hobby
                which combines thrill, freedom and skill.

            <h2>How does Skiing work</h2>
            <p>
                Skiing works by using long and flat boards called "skis", these so called boards has advanced greatly since the dawn of skiing.
                Present day skis typically aren't just boards but rather a complex combination of multiple materials.
                The skis are attached to the participants feet using bindings. As the skier moves across a slope, gravity pulls them downwards,
                generating the speed. The skis are long enough where the weight of the skier is distributed across the snow,
                preventing the skier from sinking. The bottom of the skis aren't rough but rather very smooth, preventing friction to 
                allow the skier to glide smoothly across the snow. Of course, snow has a very slippery surface which also allows the skier 
                to glide down across the slope.

            <h2>History of Skiing</h2>
            <p>
                The dawn of skiing dates back 8 thousand years ago in northern Europe and Asia. At this point, the skis were very primitive.
                Skis were constructed out of wood and were used to traverse across the difficult snowy tundra. These skis were very long and narrow,
                longer than traditional skis we see today. For thousands of years, skiing was a form of transportation and survival. It was not until
                the 19th century where skiing expanded into its beautiful form we see today. Norwegian military personnel began using skis
                in skill competitions. These competitions involved, navigating forests, skiing down slopes and shooting targets. This created the famous
                winter olympic sport of biathlon. By the 20th century, skiing expanded into the recreational activity we all known today. Skiing has
                continued to grow and advance.
